	The quickly changing workforce, or “organizations,” and the need for employees to become more proficient in learning and developing complex skills is discussed in this article.
	The authors conducted a study focusing on e-learning in the workplace and found that organizations can reduce the time it takes to develop complex skills using five e-learning strategies.
	Raman K Attri, the primary author, has a Professional Doctorate in Corporate Training, and he has 20 years of experience in technical training and management.
	Dr. Wing S. Wu is his co-author and research supervisor. While this article doesn’t talk about specific technical communication practices, these practices would be considered “complex skills”
	in the workplace. This particular article is different than other sources as it focuses on e-learning for proficiency and speed.

	This article reviews a study done by the author to determine what technical communication managers
	think about the current direction of education and training within the technical communication field,
	to include the workplace. It was determined that in addition to desired degrees and skillsets for the
	technical communication career track, the managers believe there is a “glass ceiling” leading to technical
	communicators leaving their professions in order to advance. Miles A. Kimball has a PhD and is currently
	a professor in the Department of Communication and Media at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He has
	written several pieces about technical communication, another of which is used as a resource. This article
	is valuable to research as it will support the importance of training and development in the workplace in
	order to create stable career advancement. It’s different than other sources as it includes specific
	feedback from managers within the technical workplace, providing a more hands on point of view.

	Technical communication has evolved through three different ages: Brass, Beige and Glass.
	Through research of changing disciplines and professions over the years, the author has concluded
	this is the Golden Age of technical communication and calls for a broadened scope on the industry.
	Miles A. Kimball has a PhD and is currently a professor in the Department of Communication and Media
	at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He has written several pieces about technical communication,
	another of which is used as a resource. With this being a prosperous time in technical history,
	it’s more important than ever that technical communicators are prepared for the changing workplace.
	Unlike other sources, this article offers a historical viewpoint of the technical communication industry
	which will further support the claim of the changing technical workplace.

	This article analyzes a study completed by the authors focusing on five different aspects of social
	media within e-learning in the workplace: Wiki, Blog, Forum, Chat and Video Conference. While the
	study ultimately did not reveal an interactive learning culture through the added social media outlets,
	it did reveal a need for a specifically structured approach for e-learning in for an interactive learning
	culture in the workplace. Juha Leino, Erika Tanhua-Piiroinen and Johanna Sommers- Piiroinen collaboratively
	completed this study and published this article through The University of Tampere/School of Information
	Sciences/TRIM. The team of three have contributed several other publications regarding e-learning and
	workplace learner experiences. As also stated in this article, there is little to no research done in
	regards to social media practices and benefits in e-learning and the workplace. This article will help
	support the need for further research and studies to be conducted on e-learning within the workplace.
	This is the only source to specifically discuss social media and interactive learning cultures within the
	workplace.

	The current conditions of technical and professional communication (TPC) are reviewed in this article.
	It was determined there is a need to prove value of technical and professional communication due to
	misconceptions in the workplace that TPC is expendable. Emily January Peterson has a PhD in Theory and
	Practice of Professional Communication, and she received honorable mention for the 2017 CCCC Outstanding
	Dissertation in Technical Communication. Because of the misconceptions of TPC, more studies need to be
	completed to reveal the growing importance of TPC. This resource focuses on the misconceptions in the
	workplace within the current conditions rather than changes or the evolution of TPC as other resources
	discuss.

	As several studies have shown, there are challenges in teaching technical communications and individuals
	are continuously looking for better ways to teach technical curriculum. This article evaluates importance
	of technical literacy in education and discusses different learning techniques. Dr Corinne Renguette is
	the Program Director of Technical Communication at IUPUI, as well as the Director for the Technical
	Communication Writing Center. She also is acting as correspondent and mentor for this research paper.
	Marjorie Rush Hovde is the Associate Professor of Technical Communication at IUPUI. Even though this
	article focuses on education practices, it discusses study and teaching techniques as well as curriculum
	planning. Practices that work in academia could work in the workplace. After all, curriculum is being
	adjusted to better reflect the technical workplace. Rather than focus on training like other resources,
	the focus is put on e-learning in academia, and it speaks directly to technological literacy and TPC
	software tools.

	This article reviews learning strategies in employment and education. The author speaks to the challenges
	in education systems and how it struggles to evolve quickly enough to keep up with changing workplace.
	Stephen Sawchuk is an Associate Editor for Education Week journal, mainly covering curriculum and instruction
	. He also has 10 years’ experience writing about K-12 education. This source offers support for the argument
	of a quickly changing workplace. It also speaks directly to curriculum planning, which will offer support to
	other curriculum sources. It’s different than other resources as it focuses solely on the importance of being
	able to learn and adapt.

<p>
	Miles Kimball, a professor in the Department of Communication and Media at the Rensselaer Polytechnic
	Institute, completed a study to analyze opinions and observations of managers within the technical
	communication workplace regarding the current direction of education and training within the technical
	communication field. Managers spoke directly to the competency of newly graduated communicators, the
	gap between formal education and the workplace and what the future of professional growth within the
	field looks like. A modified version of the Delphi methodology was used, and four rounds of data collection
	were completed through surveys and interviews.  Kimball determined that most managers preferred traditional
	degrees and skill sets for their employees. They also noted a “glass ceiling” keeping technical communicators
	from advancing within their careers, which then leads to individuals leaving their professions. To help
	combat this issue, technical communication managers strongly advise students within technical programs to
	be taught strategic thinking skills in addition to basic writing skills. This source further shows the
	importance of training and development in order to create stable career advancement within a rapidly changing
	workplace. Specific feedback from managers within the technical workplace provide a more hands-on point of
	view for this subject.
