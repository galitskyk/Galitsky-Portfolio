<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>This literature review evaluates how current e-learning tools and strategies use technical communications practices to adapt in the technical workplace. First the importance of the changing technical workplace is discussed, identifying the need for technical communicators to adapt using e-learning strategies. This is followed by analysis of current literature covering e-learning strategies in academia, workplace training and development, desired technical skillsets, and the quickly changing workplace. Through review of literature, the need for further study on e-learning in the workplace was found.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Technology is quickly evolving, and with it, so is the technical workplace. Different learning strategies, specifically e-learning tools, are being explored to keep up with the changing workplace, both academically for preparation and professionally for development. Technical communicators, those with jobs that depend on technology and the communication of and through it, are especially vulnerable to the changing industry. This study evaluates how current e-learning tools use technical communication practices to adapt in the technical workplace.  </p>
<p>Reviewing technical communication practices will provide better insight as to what specific disciplines are best used for e-learning. The purpose of this literature review is to show the lack of research and study surrounding e-learning in the workplace. Research was completed using articles and studies from academic journals published after 2012 to provide findings as up to date as possible. Focus was on qualitative research rather than methodological approaches. </p>
<h3 id="review-of-literature">Review of Literature</h3>
<p><strong>Technical Workplace</strong></p>
<p>In today’s age, every workplace could be categorized as a technical workplace simply because most workplaces now utilize technology in some form. For the purpose of this review, the workplaces discussed are within industries tied directly to and thus greatly depend on technology. </p>
<p>
	<strong>Quickly Changing.</strong>
	The evolution of technology inherently affects the evolution of the technical workplace because the workplace relies on technology. Thus, if technology is changing quickly, the technical workplace will also need to change quickly. A “rapidly changing workplace” requires employees to have the ability to continuously learn, and technical professionals are “skeptical of the ability of the K-12 and higher education systems” to keep up with the demands of technology and the quickly changing workplace (Sawchuk, 2017, p. 16).  This leads to believe that for individuals to adapt to the quickly changing workplace, they must be able and willing to continuously learn and improve skills.
</p>
<p><strong>Current Conditions in Communication.</strong> A key component to adapting to a quickly changing environment is communication, especially when said communication is relaying technical information within the organization. There is a growing importance for practitioners of technical and professional communication (TPC), yet there is a continued misconception about the value of the role (Petersen, 2017). Female practitioners of TPC were interviewed and Petersen (2017) found that many perceive the role as expendable and unnecessary. This calls for the question as to why, with such a great need to adapt to a changing workplace, technical communication is not more valued within the workplace and why its practices are not further explored.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Communication Practices</strong></p>
<p>Technical communication uses communication skills to convey technical and professional information to a specific audience. Some define it as a mode in which humans can interact with technology (Kimball, 2016b). Common practices include analyzing an audience, writing ideas in a clear, concise way and conducting research to become a subject matter expert. </p>
<p><strong>Industry Changes.</strong> The changes in technology determine the pace of the technical workplace and the ages of industry. Kimball (2016b) studied four ages in which technical communication practices were influenced by technologies such as wars, computers and the network and found that as a profession, the industry has gotten smaller, but the disciplines are incorporated into every day life more and more. Because of the vast changes seen over the ages, Kimball (2016b) calls for a broadened scope of the industry “to include workplace and professional communication” in addition to the immense amounts of technical communication performed daily. Misconceptions within the industry are typically formed between technical communication disciplines and the technical communication profession (Kimball, 2016b).  Perhaps by broadening the scope of technical communication, current misconceptions in the industry would be reduced.</p>
<p><strong>Desired Skillsets.</strong> Every profession has a list of most desired skillsets, and professions within the technical communication industry are no exception. Basic technical writing skills are expected to be gained with traditional college credentials, but managers within the industry especially look for general professional skills such as strategic and critical thinking (Kimball, 2016a). These skills can build a foundation that companies can then further build upon, a process better known within the workplace as training and development. Kimball (2016a) found that if employees had these foundational skills, they had a higher chance of seeing professional growth through training, which is a challenge within the technical workplace.</p>
<p><strong>E-Learning Tools</strong> </p>
<p>There are many different approaches to training and learning, and in our technologically advancing society, e-learning is becoming a more popular approach. E-learning can reduce time spent training and allows individuals to learn skills faster (Attri, 2016, p. 177). Tools used for e-learning are simply means to accomplishing the task of learning these new skills. Different types of e-learning tools, whether it be software or strategies, can determine the effectiveness of technology-based learning. </p>
<p><strong>Preparation in Academia.</strong> While the term training is used in the workplace, in academia, the term teaching is used because an educational environment is meant to provide the foundation for future skill development. To better prepare college students for the technical workplace, universities are redesigning teaching strategies within technical programs. Many of these strategies encourage students to “learn how to learn” by understanding their preferred learning processes and how to best learn new material (Sawchuk, 2017). </p>
<p>Being a self-guided learner is a major strength within the technical workplace. Technological literacy plays a key role in developing software skills, but the difficulties of constantly changing technology and an abundance of tool options create challenges in teaching this critical skill in an educational environment (Rush-Hovde &amp; Renguette, 2017). To effectively teach technological literacy, Rush-Hovde et al. (2017) considered how students learn to use technology, determine which tools to use and understand technological concepts and the impact of technology and communication practices on the other. Individuals able to demonstrate these abilities will be more prepared for the workplace because they will be able to better adapt to changes.</p>
<p><strong>Workplace Training and Development.</strong> Since education has already provided a foundation by teaching core skills, e-learning within the technical workplace is a mean to improve and develop employee skills. The focus, then, is on training to develop more complex skills rather than teaching to learn new skills. Learning a new software, even though new skills can be learned, is still considered a complex skill. This is another reason why specific software training is rarely seen in educational curriculum and instead left for independent study. A combination of software training and continuous professional development (CPD) training using strategies and processes is essential to create successful learning environments in the workplace (Leino, 2012). </p>
<p>One of the most attractive traits of e-learning is that it’s time-effective. While studies have shown e-learning can take less time than traditional instruction, Attri (2016) found five strategies that specifically improve e-learning proficiency with complex skills. Another study done by Leino (2012) found that instilling an interactive learning process can benefit an e-learning atmosphere. Both studies showed that using a mix of methodology and technology tools were beneficial, and learning activities should be deliberately designed and executed for maximum effects. Catering to and understanding different learning preferences among employees is essential to developing learning strategies within the workplace, but further studies need to be conducted to show further connections.</p>
<p>
	Training on software tools is considered separate from CPD training because it’s used to “level skills differences” among employees (Leino, 2012). This is precisely why this type of training is not more developed in academia, because it varies so much depending on the type of workplace and the type of responsibilities. Leino (2012) found that social tools, both synchronous and asynchronous, used for e-learning purposes within the workplace were used more for support and validation than actual skill advancement. There is an urgent need for further studies on CPD training and e-learning tools in the workplace, especially since it has not been studied nearly as much as e-learning within academia (Leino, 2012, p. 18).
</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>Through thorough research and review of literature, it was found that there is a need for further study on the topic of e-learning within the technical workplace. It is not yet clear how the top technical communication practices are used in e-learning tools within the technical workplace as research cannot yet support what is considered best practices. There is also a need for more studies proving the value of technical communication practices due to the growing importance of technical and professional communication within the quickly changing workplace. There are many studies devoted to e-learning within academia, and these studies should be used as foundations for further research on practices within the workplace. </p>
<p>To conduct further research on this topic, a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods should be used. Qualitative methods would include interviews of managers within the technical workplace overseeing employee training. Questions would cover types of tools used, types of strategies used and what mediums were most effective for training purposes. Focus groups would also be used with these same questions. </p>
<p>Studies would also need to be done to further explore which technical communication practices are best and why. Once this has been studied, more complete analysis can be done on how these practices influence e-learning within the workplace. </p>
