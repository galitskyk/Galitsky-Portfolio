*Attri, R., & Wu, W. (2016). E-learning strategies that support speed to proficiency in complex skills. 
Proceedings of the International Conference on E-Learning, 176-184.*

The quickly changing workforce, or “organizations,” and the need for employees to become more proficient in learning and developing complex skills is discussed in this article. 
The authors conducted a study focusing on e-learning in the workplace and found that organizations can reduce the time it takes to develop complex skills using five e-learning strategies. 
Raman K Attri, the primary author, has a Professional Doctorate in Corporate Training, and he has 20 years of experience in technical training and management. 
Dr. Wing S. Wu is his co-author and research supervisor. While this article doesn’t talk about specific technical communication practices, these practices would be considered “complex skills” 
in the workplace. This particular article is different than other sources as it focuses on e-learning for proficiency and speed.

*Kimball, M. A. (2016). Training and education: technical communication managers speak out. 
Technical Communication, 62(2), 135-145.*

This article reviews a study done by the author to determine what technical communication managers 
think about the current direction of education and training within the technical communication field, 
to include the workplace. It was determined that in addition to desired degrees and skillsets for the 
technical communication career track, the managers believe there is a “glass ceiling” leading to technical 
communicators leaving their professions in order to advance. Miles A. Kimball has a PhD and is currently 
a professor in the Department of Communication and Media at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He has 
written several pieces about technical communication, another of which is used as a resource. This article 
is valuable to research as it will support the importance of training and development in the workplace in
order to create stable career advancement. It’s different than other sources as it includes specific 
feedback from managers within the technical workplace, providing a more hands on point of view. 

*Kimball, M. A. (2016). The golden age of technical communication. 
Journal of Technical Writing and Communication, 47(3), 330-358. DOI: 10.1177/0047281616641927*

Technical communication has evolved through three different ages: Brass, Beige and Glass. 
Through research of changing disciplines and professions over the years, the author has concluded 
this is the Golden Age of technical communication and calls for a broadened scope on the industry. 
Miles A. Kimball has a PhD and is currently a professor in the Department of Communication and Media 
at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He has written several pieces about technical communication, 
another of which is used as a resource. With this being a prosperous time in technical history, 
it’s more important than ever that technical communicators are prepared for the changing workplace. 
Unlike other sources, this article offers a historical viewpoint of the technical communication industry 
which will further support the claim of the changing technical workplace. 

*Leino, J., Tanhua- Piiroinen, E., & Sommers-Piiroinen, J. (2012). 
Adding social media to e-learning in the workplace: instilling interactive learning culture. 
International Journal of Advanced Corporate Learning 5(3), 18-25.*

This article analyzes a study completed by the authors focusing on five different aspects of social 
media within e-learning in the workplace: Wiki, Blog, Forum, Chat and Video Conference. While the 
study ultimately did not reveal an interactive learning culture through the added social media outlets, 
it did reveal a need for a specifically structured approach for e-learning in for an interactive learning 
culture in the workplace. Juha Leino, Erika Tanhua-Piiroinen and Johanna Sommers- Piiroinen collaboratively 
completed this study and published this article through The University of Tampere/School of Information 
Sciences/TRIM. The team of three have contributed several other publications regarding e-learning and 
workplace learner experiences. As also stated in this article, there is little to no research done in 
regards to social media practices and benefits in e-learning and the workplace. This article will help 
support the need for further research and studies to be conducted on e-learning within the workplace. 
This is the only source to specifically discuss social media and interactive learning cultures within the 
workplace. 

*Petersen, E. J. (2017). Articulating value amid persistent misconceptions about technical and 
professional communication in the workplace. Technical Communication 64(3), 210-222.*

The current conditions of technical and professional communication (TPC) are reviewed in this article. 
It was determined there is a need to prove value of technical and professional communication due to 
misconceptions in the workplace that TPC is expendable. Emily January Peterson has a PhD in Theory and 
Practice of Professional Communication, and she received honorable mention for the 2017 CCCC Outstanding 
Dissertation in Technical Communication. Because of the misconceptions of TPC, more studies need to be 
completed to reveal the growing importance of TPC. This resource focuses on the misconceptions in the 
workplace within the current conditions rather than changes or the evolution of TPC as other resources 
discuss. 

*Rush Hovde, M., & Renguette C. C. (2017). Technological literacy: a framework for teaching 
technical communication software tools. Technical Communication Quarterly, 26(4), 395-411. 
DOI: 10.1080/10572252.2017.1385998*

As several studies have shown, there are challenges in teaching technical communications and individuals 
are continuously looking for better ways to teach technical curriculum. This article evaluates importance
of technical literacy in education and discusses different learning techniques. Dr Corinne Renguette is 
the Program Director of Technical Communication at IUPUI, as well as the Director for the Technical 
Communication Writing Center. She also is acting as correspondent and mentor for this research paper. 
Marjorie Rush Hovde is the Associate Professor of Technical Communication at IUPUI. Even though this 
article focuses on education practices, it discusses study and teaching techniques as well as curriculum 
planning. Practices that work in academia could work in the workplace. After all, curriculum is being 
adjusted to better reflect the technical workplace. Rather than focus on training like other resources, 
the focus is put on e-learning in academia, and it speaks directly to technological literacy and TPC 
software tools.

*Sawchuk, S. (2017). Learning how to learn: in a fast changing workplace, the ability to 
acquire new knowledge is a valued skill. Education Week. 37(6), 16-18.*

This article reviews learning strategies in employment and education. The author speaks to the challenges 
in education systems and how it struggles to evolve quickly enough to keep up with changing workplace. 
Stephen Sawchuk is an Associate Editor for Education Week journal, mainly covering curriculum and instruction
. He also has 10 years’ experience writing about K-12 education. This source offers support for the argument
of a quickly changing workplace. It also speaks directly to curriculum planning, which will offer support to 
other curriculum sources. It’s different than other resources as it focuses solely on the importance of being 
able to learn and adapt.
