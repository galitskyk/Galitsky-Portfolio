## Abstract
*Kimball, M. A. (2016). Training and education: technical communication managers speak out. Technical 
Communication, 62(2), 135-145.*

Miles Kimball, a professor in the Department of Communication and Media at the Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute, completed a study to analyze opinions and observations of managers within the technical 
communication workplace regarding the current direction of education and training within the technical 
communication field. Managers spoke directly to the competency of newly graduated communicators, the 
gap between formal education and the workplace and what the future of professional growth within the 
field looks like. A modified version of the Delphi methodology was used, and four rounds of data collection 
were completed through surveys and interviews.  Kimball determined that most managers preferred traditional 
degrees and skill sets for their employees. They also noted a “glass ceiling” keeping technical communicators 
from advancing within their careers, which then leads to individuals leaving their professions. To help 
combat this issue, technical communication managers strongly advise students within technical programs to 
be taught strategic thinking skills in addition to basic writing skills. This source further shows the 
importance of training and development in order to create stable career advancement within a rapidly changing 
workplace. Specific feedback from managers within the technical workplace provide a more hands-on point of 
view for this subject.
