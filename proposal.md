###### Kassie Galitsky | Indiana University Purdue University at Indianapolis

### Abstract

Because technical communication makes complex information understandable, using technical communication practices in e-learning tools can help train and develop employees on more complex subjects in a more efficient way. This study evaluated how current e-learning tools use technical communication practices to adapt in the changing technical workplace. Through review of literature within the last 6 years, the need for further research on how current e-learning tools within the technical workplace use technical communication practices was confirmed. For continued research, qualitative research methods will be used, including interviews and case studies using focus groups comprised of technical professionals. Results and findings are expected to reveal that using technical communication practices - which are also expected to be revealed through further research – in e-learning tools within the technical workplace can increase efficiency in learning and applying complex skills.                     


### Introduction

Technology is quickly evolving, and with it, so is the modern workplace. Most every business or company uses technology in some fashion, and there are some companies that exist solely because of technology. As the use of technology increases, so does the need for better understanding of said technologies. It’s the job of a technical communicator to make this possible and easily attainable.

Different learning strategies, specifically e-learning tools, are being explored to keep up with the changing workplace, both academically for preparation and professionally for development. Technical communicators and those with jobs that depend on technology and the communication of and through it are especially vulnerable to the changing industry. This study evaluated how current e-learning tools use technical communication practices to adapt in the changing technical workplace.  

Because technical communication makes complex information understandable, using technical communication practices in e-learning tools can help train and develop employees on more complex subjects in a more effecient way. 

### Literature Review

For individuals to adapt to the quickly changing workplace, they must be able and willing to continuously learn and improve skills. As said by Sawchuk, a “rapidly changing workplace” requires employees to have the ability to continuously learn, and technical professionals are “skeptical of the ability of the K-12 and higher education systems” to keep up with the demands of technology and the quickly changing workplace. A key component to adapting to a quickly changing environment is communication, and while there is a growing importance for practitioners of technical and professional communication (TPC), Petersen’s study showed there is still a continued misconception about the value of the role. 

Kimball studied four ages in which technical communication practices were influenced by technologies such as wars, computers and the network and found that as a profession, the industry has gotten smaller, but the disciplines are incorporated into everyday life more and more. Because of the vast changes seen over the ages, Kimball calls for a broadened scope of the industry “to include workplace and professional communication” in addition to the immense amounts of technical communication performed daily.

Basic technical writing skills are expected to be gained with traditional college credentials, but Kimball’s 2016 study showed managers within the industry especially look for general professional skills such as strategic and critical thinking. Kimball also found that if employees had these foundational skills, they had a higher chance of seeing professional growth through training, which is a challenge within the technical workplace.

E-learning can reduce time spent training and allows individuals to learn skills faster, according to Attri. Technological literacy plays a key role in developing software skills, but, as Rush-Hovde & Renguette concluded, the difficulties of constantly changing technology and an abundance of tool options create challenges in teaching this critical skill in an educational environment. To effectively teach technological literacy, Rush-Hovde et al. considered how students learn to use technology, determine which tools to use and understand technological concepts and the impact of technology and communication practices on the other. 

With education within academia providing a core foundation, e-learning provides further training and development for employees to learn complex skills. Leino found that a combination of software training and continuous professional development (CPD) training using strategies and processes is essential to create successful learning environments in the workplace. While studies have shown e-learning can take less time than traditional instruction, Attri found five strategies that specifically improve e-learning proficiency with complex skills. Another study done by Leino found that instilling an interactive learning process can benefit an e-learning atmosphere. Both studies showed that using a mix of methodology and technology tools were beneficial, and learning activities should be deliberately designed and executed for maximum effects. 

Leino found that social tools used for e-learning purposes within the workplace were used more for support and validation than actual skill advancement. According to Leino, there is an urgent need for further studies on CPD training and e-learning tools in the workplace, especially since it has not been studied nearly as much as e-learning within academia. 

### Proposed Methodology

By means of thorough research and review of literature, the need for further research on how current e-learning tools within the technical workplace use technical communication practices was confirmed. Recent studies, that is studies within the last 6 years, regarding technical communication as a whole are sorely lacking. Although the value of using core skills in e-learning is seen, it is not yet clear how the top technical communication practices are used in e-learning tools within the technical workplace as research cannot yet support what these specific practices are. 

With such a great need to adapt to a changing workplace and with the technical communication industry currently undervalued, practices should be further explored to demonstrate the importance of the profession and the value of using practices in e-learning. There are many studies devoted to e-learning within academia, and these studies should be used as foundations for further research on practices within the workplace.

To conduct further research on this topic, qualitative research methods should be used. The first step is to determine the top technical communication practices outside of academia. This can be accomplished by evaluating current technical communication deliverables in various technical workplaces. Studying these deliverables and how their intended audience received the information will allow for a better understanding of what practices work best. Interviews with managers and senior employees within the technical workplace overseeing employee training will further build on Kimball’s 2016 study and give better insight as to what types of training formats are most effective. Questions would cover types of tools used, types of strategies used and what training mediums were most effective.  

Using the above studies, a case study will be completed using two focus groups, comprised of technical employees from various technical workplaces, to further explore which technical communication practices are most effective and why. This will be done by having the focus groups evaluate e-learning tools that use technical communication practices and tools that don’t use technical communication practices. Results are expected to reveal which group was able to learn and apply complex information best. 

### Resource Allocation

It will take three months to complete the proposed methods of research, assuming no delays in gathering information from participants. Costs will be minimal as information will be obtained mainly through interviews and case studies. The type of e-learning tool used will determine the cost associated with the case study. Adobe Captivate can be used to create e-learning materials, and with a subscription it costs $29.99/mo.  Microsoft PowerPoint could also be used at no cost, however it would take more time to create e-learning material that may not be as professional. 

|  Description of work  |  Schedule  (days)  |
|  :------------------  | :----------------: |
|  Accumulation of current technical communication deliverables | 1 - 6
|  Evaluation of deliverables  | 5 - 10
|  Develop questions for interviews  | 11 - 18
|  Find interview participants: various managers and senior employees  | 19 - 26
|  Conduct interviews  |27 - 34
|  Evaluate interview results  |35 - 42
|  *Optional* Repeat interviews and evaluate  | 43 - 53

|  Find focus group participants: various technical professionals  | 55 - 62
|  Conduct study | 63 - 70
|  Evaluate study results | 71 - 78
|  *Optional* Repeat interviews and evaluate |	78 - 88
|  Analyze results and findings of three studies |	84 - 91

### Evaluation

As most information gathered will be qualitative through interviews and case studies using professionals, complete and thorough data may not be obtained during the first attempt. It could also take additional time to become familiarize with Adobe Captivate if not yet versed in. Extra time has been allocated for these potential setbacks; if it is not needed, the research can assume ahead of schedule.  

Results and findings of the three studies are expected to reveal that using technical communication practices - which are also expected to be revealed – in e-learning tools within the technical workplace can increase efficiency in learning and applying complex skills.                               

### Conclusion

As the use of technology quickly increases in the modern workplace, the need for better understanding of said technologies becomes more essential. Technical communication practices present complex information in a simple way. Using those practices in e-learning tools can help train and develop employees on more complex subjects in a more efficient way. The proposed research is expected to not only support this hypothesis but also build upon existing, yet lacking, research done on e-learning within the technical workplace.
